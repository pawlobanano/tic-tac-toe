# Tic Tac Toe
a mini project in pure JavaScript

#### How to prepare development environment?
Clone this repository, then from inside it and write:
```javascript
npm install
gulp serve
```
This should start a new tab with this application in your default internet browser.

###### P.S. [gulp-cli](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md "gulp-cli") is needed globally in your system.

#### TODO:
- tests
- fixing layout if animation are utilized on X/O signs
